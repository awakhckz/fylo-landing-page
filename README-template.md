## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While developing this site, I face issues with the images and links especially at the footer section. The social accounts hover image switched and also the logo color switch. Though I've come across something like it while on **YouTube** but at thiat moment, everything skipped my mind.
So just like the programmers meme always say, **"when you get stuck on a line of code; take a shower and a calm nap, come back and the line is solved"**
I did exactly that and well, it worked for me just fine. 

Some of the codes that helped me below:

```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.fb:hover {
  content: url(images/facebook-logo-502.jpg);
}
.logo {
  filter: brightness(0) invert(100);
}
```

### Continued development

On my rate as a dev I would say I still have more to look on focusing on the filter and also psudo elements.
